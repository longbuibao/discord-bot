-- container aren't mini VM
	- they are just processes
	- limit resources that they can access
	- exit when process stops
-- ps aux: linux command list all running processes

-- docker start 'container name'
	- start a docker container ran previously

-- There is no difference between `docker ps` and `docker container ls`

inheritance:
	-- one object gets access to properties and methods of another object
classical inheritance and prototype inheritance
	-- classical: very verbose, can be end up with a huge, massive collections and tree of objects
	-- prototypal inheritance: something much simpler, flexible, extensible, easy to understand
-> inheritance in js is different from other programming language

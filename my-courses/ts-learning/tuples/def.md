# Tuple

Array-like structure where each element represent some property of a record
Whereas an array tells us a bunch of different records or organizes a collection of different records
A tuple usually contains multiple different properties to describe one single thing

> Object representing a drink
> `{ color: brown, carbonated: true, sugar: 40 }` > `[ brown, true, 40 ]`
> We have to memorize the fact that the first element inside this array represent the `color`, the second is `carbonated`, the third is `sugar`
> This is what a tuple is, we put in our property values in a very specific order way, so the ordering part is really critical

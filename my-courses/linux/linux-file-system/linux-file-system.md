# The Linux File System

- A file system controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without file system, data placed on a storage medium, like a hard disk drive or USB stick would be one large body of data with no way of telling where one piece of it stops and where another one begin. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified.
- Each group of data is called a _file_ and the structure and the logic rules used to manage files and their names are called _file systems_.
- In other words, a file system is a logical collection of files on a partition or disk. Your hard drive can have multiple partitions, which usally contain only one file system, which usually contain only one file system.
- On a Linux system, everything is considered to be a file.
